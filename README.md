# Project Name:
- Student Academic Performance Exploration

# Project Objective:
- To analyze student data and uncover key factors influencing academic performance, attendance, and engagement.

# Key Questions / KPIs Answered:

- What factors most affect student performance?
- How does attendance correlate with grades?
- Are there patterns based on gender, study hours, or parental education?
- Average performance score by subject and demographic
- Identification of high- and low-performing student clusters

# Process Overview:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing using Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using visualizations (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Feature correlation and outlier detection
- Derived metrics and grouped insights
- Final summary and actionable observations

# Project Insights:

- Strong correlation found between study time, parental education, and student scores
- Higher absences led to significantly lower academic performance
- Students with support systems performed consistently better
- Gender differences observed in subject preferences and performance
